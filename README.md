# xChange: Cross-Chain Bridge Interface

xChange is a decentralized bridge interface that enables seamless asset transfers between Bitcoin and the Stacks blockchain. The project implements atomic swaps using Clarity smart contracts and provides a user-friendly interface for managing cross-chain transactions.

## Features

- Secure atomic swaps between Bitcoin and Stacks
- Support for wrapped Bitcoin (xBTC) operations
- Real-time transaction status monitoring
- User-friendly interface for managing cross-chain transfers
- Comprehensive security measures and verification system

## Smart Contract Architecture

The core smart contract implements the following key functions:

- `deposit-stx`: Allows users to deposit STX tokens into the bridge
- `initiate-swap`: Initiates a cross-chain swap with specified parameters
- `complete-swap`: Finalizes the swap after verification
- `get-pending-swap`: Retrieves information about pending swaps
- `get-balance`: Checks user balances in the contract

## Prerequisites

- [Stacks Wallet](https://www.hiro.so/wallet)
- [Clarity CLI](https://docs.stacks.co/references/claritycli)
- Node.js v14 or higher
- Bitcoin node (optional for running a full node)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/xchange.git
cd xchange
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Configure environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration
```

## Smart Contract Deployment

1. Build the contract:
```bash
clarity-cli build contracts/xchange.clar
```

2. Deploy to testnet:
```bash
stx deploy_contract xchange.clar
```

## Usage

### Initiating a Swap

1. Connect your Stacks wallet
2. Enter the amount to swap
3. Provide the recipient Bitcoin address
4. Confirm the transaction
5. Monitor the swap status

### Completing a Swap

The swap completion process is automated through the contract's verification system. Users can monitor the status through the interface.

## Security Considerations

- All smart contracts have been audited by [Audit Firm Name]
- Implements timelock mechanisms for safety
- Multi-signature requirements for admin functions
- Regular security updates and monitoring

## Development

### Local Development

1. Start the local development environment:
```bash
npm run dev
```

2. Run tests:
```bash
npm test
```

### Testing

The project includes comprehensive test suites:

- Unit tests for smart contracts
- Integration tests for the bridge interface
- End-to-end testing scenarios
